Currently I am just trying out Git and Cloud9 with a simple mfcc implementation and unittest.

This was tricky and there is no documentation!

It's the console and input line at the bottom of the UI.

git add .
git status
git commit  --all --verbose --message="Test of cloud 9 integration"
or actually
git commit -a -v -m Test of cloud 9 integration
